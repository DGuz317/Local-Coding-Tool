# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- `CONTEXT.md` at the repo root for the RepoLens glossary and planning language.
- `docs/adr/` for architectural decisions that touch the area being changed.

If any of these files do not exist, proceed silently. Do not suggest creating them upfront.

## File structure

This repo uses a single-context layout:

```text
/
├── CONTEXT.md
├── docs/adr/
└── src/
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When output names a domain concept in an issue title, refactor proposal, hypothesis, or test name, use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Do not drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

## Flag ADR conflicts

If output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding.
